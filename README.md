# Data Science Data Visualization Project – Story of Minister Officials Travel Expenses
This is my second project in the data visualisation course that I have completed using data science skills such as data cleaning, wrangling, analysis and visualization skills such as data story telling, dashboarding, interactive data visualizations.
The dataset that I have used for this project was the “Travel Expenses issued by Minister officials” which has the Open Government License – Canada
In this, tried to analyse travel patterns and reasoning for the changes and the impact of travel expenses to the total cost.
There are two reports on analysis,
1. Exploratory data analysis on the dataset to find out the behavior and the correlation among the numerical columns, categorical columns. Next, to investigate about the missing values, data types and data behaviour.
2.	Analysis based on, the questions arose from the exploratory data analysis
